#Improvr App 

This is a public repository for a studying app I built in 2022. 

This was a web-based version,  of an app I built before this, that allowed users to run a study timer, track their study sessions, analyze their trends, create study templates, and create tasks lists. This project used the Reactjs framework, along with Firebase for the back end, I also implemented the Spotify API, the Youtube API and created a backgroundâ€™s system for customization by users as well as designing a database structure and cloud functions for the web app. The web app grew to over 300 users in 3 months and I promoted the app in collaboration with foreign content creators, this content reached over 20k views.
